# Module & feature map

This is the internal working reference for anyone (human or Claude Code) extending Servio. It maps every feature to its real files so you can jump straight to the right place. Every path below was verified against the code.

Servio has two surfaces:

| Surface | Route root | Audience | Layout |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Agent console** | `app/(console)/*` | Agents, managers, admins | `app/(console)/layout.tsx` (sidebar + topbar) |
| **Self-service portal** | `app/portal/*` | End users (requesters) | `app/portal/layout.tsx` (portal nav) |

Auth pages live at `app/login` (not a route group). There is **no `src/` directory** — everything is at the repo root. The request middleware is `proxy.ts` (Next 16 naming), not `middleware.ts`. See [architecture.md](./architecture.md) for the request lifecycle and auth/role gating.

## Per-module anatomy

Console modules follow one consistent shape. When adding a feature, mirror this layout so agents and contributors can predict where things live:

| Concern | Location | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| List page | `app/(console)/<mod>/page.tsx` | Server Component; queries `lib/db`, renders table/cards. `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"`. Filters + pagination are URL-driven; tables sort via `<SortableHead>` (`?sort=&dir=`, mapped to a Prisma `orderBy`). |
| Detail page | `app/(console)/<mod>/[id]/page.tsx` | Loads one record + related data; renders a `*-properties` panel and action components. |
| Create page | `app/(console)/<mod>/new/page.tsx` | Renders the `*-form` component. Some modules create via a dialog instead (e.g. Locations, Categories). |
| Server actions | `lib/actions/<mod>.ts` | All mutations. `"use server"`, Zod-validated, role-checked via `lib/session`, then `revalidatePath`. |
| UI components | `components/<mod>/` | Client components: forms, dialogs, property panels, action buttons. |
| Select options | `lib/data/options.ts` | Single cached `getFormOptions()` supplies dropdown data (users, groups, categories, services, etc.) to every form. |

Enums, status/priority metadata, and reference helpers (`ticketRef`, `problemRef`, `changeRef`, `PRIORITY_META`, `TICKET_STATUS_META`, `OPEN_TICKET_STATUSES`) live in `lib/constants.ts` — **not** `lib/enums.ts`. Navigation grouping and per-item role gating live in `lib/nav.ts` (`consoleNav`, `filterNav`). See [data-model.md](./data-model.md) for the underlying Prisma models. To contribute a new module, follow the pattern below and read [../CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Navigation groups

`lib/nav.ts` groups console modules and gates each by `minRole` (`AGENT` < `MANAGER` < `ADMIN`; `filterNav` hides items above the user's rank):

| Group | Modules |
| --- | --- |
| Overview | Dashboard (`/`), Vio (`/assistant`) |
| Service Desk | Tickets, Problems, Changes, Approvals, Knowledge Base |
| Catalog | Services, Service Catalog (MANAGER+) |
| CMDB | Assets, Locations |
| Organisation | Groups, People, Categories |
| Administration | Automations (MANAGER+), Syncs (MANAGER+), Settings (MANAGER+) |

---

## Overview

### Vio (AI assistant)
Servio's built-in AI service-desk agent — a standalone chat surface that can read the queue,
search the app and the web, and **propose changes the user approves before anything is written**.
Full write-up: [ai.md](./ai.md).

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Routes | `app/(console)/assistant/page.tsx`, `layout.tsx` (route `/assistant`, AGENT+) |
| Actions | `lib/actions/ai-assistant.ts` (`listConversations`, `createConversation`, `getConversation`, `renameConversation`, `archiveConversation`, `sendMessage`, `applyAssistantProposal`) |
| Components | `components/assistant/` (`assistant-shell`, `chat-panel`, `message-list`, `conversation-list`, `proposal-card`, `vio-launcher`, `typing-dots`) |
| Provider layer | `lib/ai.ts` (config + privacy gate), `lib/claude-cli.ts` (Claude Agent SDK adapter) |
| Read tools | `lib/assistant-tools.ts`, `lib/ai-tools.ts`, `lib/ai-admin-tools.ts`, `lib/ai-stats.ts` |
| Write operations | `lib/ai-operations/` (`registry.ts`, `types.ts`, `tools.ts`, `modules/*` — tickets, taxonomy, org, catalog-services, cmdb, knowledge, problems-changes, config) |
| Settings | `app/(console)/settings/ai/page.tsx` (ADMIN) |
| Data | `AiConversation`, `AiMessage` (`prisma/schema.prisma`) |

Every write is an RBAC-gated `AiOperation` surfaced as a `propose_*` tool; `applyAssistantProposal`
re-checks role/scope and re-validates args before running the real mutation. A top-bar launcher
(`vio-launcher`) opens the same assistant from anywhere in the console.

---

## Service Operations

### Tickets
The core incident/request module and the richest one in the codebase.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Routes | `app/(console)/tickets/page.tsx`, `[id]/page.tsx`, `new/page.tsx` |
| Actions | `lib/actions/tickets.ts` |
| Components | `components/tickets/` |

Actions include `createTicket`, `updateTicketField` (incl. switching `type` — the ref prefix stays fixed), `updateTicketDetails`, `addTicketComment`, `escalateTicket`, `toggleMajorIncident`, `toggleWatch`, `addParticipant`, `linkTicket`/`unlinkTicket`, `mergeTicket`, cross-entity linking (`setTicketProblem`, `setTicketChange`, `linkAsset`/`unlinkAsset`, `unlinkRelation`), `setTicketResolution`, `setTicketPending`, `setTicketDueDate`, `forwardTicketExternal`, and work-log entries (`addWorkLog`, `deleteWorkLog`). Key components: `ticket-form`, `ticket-properties` (staged edits incl. type + due date), `ticket-actions`, `comment-composer`, `work-log`, `resolution-dialog`, `pending-reason-dialog`, `due-date-picker`, `sla-badge`, `form-answers`, plus the reusable `link-picker` (attach problems/changes/assets) and `saved-views-bar`.

**Saved views:** `/tickets` carries a searchable list of saved filter sets (`SavedView`) — apply/save/delete named filters, personal or (MANAGER+) shared with a team. Actions in `lib/actions/saved-views.ts`.

**Bulk actions & sorting:** the tickets table (`components/tickets/tickets-table.tsx`) has row checkboxes + a bulk bar to set assignee/team/priority/status on many tickets at once (`bulkUpdateTickets` re-runs `updateTicketField` per ticket, so transitions/SLA/automations stay correct). All list tables (tickets, problems, changes, assets, people, groups) have sortable columns via `components/sort-header.tsx`.

### Problems

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Routes | `app/(console)/problems/page.tsx`, `[id]/page.tsx`, `new/page.tsx` |
| Actions | `lib/actions/problems.ts` — `createProblem`, `updateProblemField`, `updateProblemDetails`, `addProblemComment` |
| Components | `components/problems/` — `problem-form`, `problem-properties`, `create-problem-dialog` |

### Changes
Includes a built-in approval workflow.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Routes | `app/(console)/changes/page.tsx`, `[id]/page.tsx`, `new/page.tsx` |
| Actions | `lib/actions/changes.ts` — `createChange`, `updateChangeField`, `updateChangeDetails`, `addChangeComment`, `submitChangeForApproval`, `addChangeApprover`, `removeChangeApprover`, `decideApproval` |
| Components | `components/changes/` — `change-form`, `change-properties`, `approval-panel`, `approval-actions`, `add-approver`, `remove-approver`, `submit-for-approval` |

### Approvals
A cross-cutting inbox for the current user's pending approvals (currently backed by change approvals).

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Route | `app/(console)/approvals/page.tsx` (list only — no detail/new) |
| Actions | `lib/actions/approvals.ts` — `decideApproval` |
| Components | `components/approvals/approval-decision` |

---

## Catalog & CMDB

### Services
The service portfolio (business/technical services tickets are filed against).

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Routes | `app/(console)/services/page.tsx`, `[id]/page.tsx`, `new/page.tsx` |
| Actions | `lib/actions/services.ts` — `createService`, `updateServiceField` |
| Components | `components/services/` — `service-form`, `service-properties`, `create-service-dialog` |

### Service Catalog (admin)
The requestable-item catalog editor (MANAGER+; `requireRole("MANAGER")`). List-style admin page — no `[id]`/`new` routes; items are edited inline.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Route | `app/(console)/catalog/page.tsx` |
| Actions | `lib/actions/catalog-admin.ts` — `createCatalogItem`, `updateCatalogItem`, `toggleCatalogPublished`, `deleteCatalogItem` |
| Components | `components/catalog/` — `catalog-editor`, `catalog-browser`, `catalog-icon`, `publish-toggle` |

Catalog request forms are defined via `lib/service-forms.ts` (`parseFormSchema`). The requester-facing catalog lives in the portal (below); `lib/actions/catalog.ts` (`createCatalogRequest`) is the request-submission action shared with the portal.

### Assets (CMDB)

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Routes | `app/(console)/assets/page.tsx`, `[id]/page.tsx`, `new/page.tsx` |
| Actions | `lib/actions/assets.ts` — `createAsset`, `updateAssetField`, `updateAsset` |
| Components | `components/assets/` — `asset-form`, `asset-properties`, `asset-edit-dialog` |

### Locations
Created/edited via dialog (no `new/` route).

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Routes | `app/(console)/locations/page.tsx`, `[id]/page.tsx` |
| Actions | `lib/actions/locations.ts` — `createLocation`, `updateLocation`, `deleteLocation` |
| Components | `components/locations/location-dialog` |

### Categories
Ticket/problem/change categorisation tree.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Routes | `app/(console)/categories/page.tsx`, `new/page.tsx` |
| Actions | `lib/actions/categories.ts` — `createCategory`, `updateCategory` |
| Components | `components/categories/` — `category-form`, `create-category-dialog` |

### Knowledge base
The only console module keyed by `slug` instead of `[id]`, with a dedicated edit route.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Routes | `app/(console)/knowledge/page.tsx`, `[slug]/page.tsx`, `[slug]/edit/page.tsx`, `new/page.tsx` |
| Actions | `lib/actions/knowledge.ts` — `createArticle`, `updateArticle`, `changeArticleStatus`, `deleteArticle` |
| Components | `components/knowledge/article-editor` (uses the shared `components/ui/rich-text-editor`) |

---

## Organisation

### Groups / Teams
Groups are the unit of assignment/auto-routing (they replaced Queues). Includes auto-assign configuration.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Routes | `app/(console)/groups/page.tsx`, `[id]/page.tsx`, `new/page.tsx` |
| Actions | `lib/actions/groups.ts` — `createGroup`, `setGroupAutoAssign` |
| Components | `components/groups/` — `group-form`, `create-group-dialog`, `auto-assign-control` |

### People
User directory. Read-heavy; users are typically provisioned via syncs, so there is no `new/` route.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Routes | `app/(console)/people/page.tsx`, `[id]/page.tsx` |
| Actions | `lib/actions/people.ts` — `updateUserField` |
| Components | `components/people/user-properties` |

### Dashboards

Customizable widget dashboards on the home page (`/`). Every user gets a personal **"My Dashboard"**; managers/admins can create dashboards shared with a team or everyone. A searchable dropdown switches dashboards; **Edit** mode is a drag/resize grid ([react-grid-layout](https://github.com/react-grid-layout/react-grid-layout)) with per-widget config and a live preview.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Routes | `app/(console)/page.tsx` (view + `?edit=1` editor); `app/api/dashboard/widget` (live-preview compute) |
| Actions | `lib/actions/dashboards.ts` — `ensurePersonalDashboard`, `createDashboard`, `setDashboardLayout`, `updateDashboardSettings`, `renameDashboard`, `deleteDashboard` |
| Engine / types | `lib/dashboard/compute.ts` (server metric engine), `lib/dashboard/types.ts` (`Widget`, `DEFAULT_LAYOUT`) |
| Components | `dashboard-picker`, `dashboard-grid-view`, `dashboard-canvas` (editor), `widget-card`, `widget-config-dialog`; charts in `components/charts` |

Widget types: **stat**, **breakdown** (bar or donut; group by priority/status/type/assignee/team/category/service/source/impact/urgency), **volume** trend, **SLA & MTTR** gauge, **aging**, and **ticket list**. Each widget carries its own filters and an optional accent colour; stat widgets support value **thresholds** (e.g. `< 15 → red`) that tint the whole card. Stat/SLA cards and every breakdown segment drill into the matching `/tickets` filter URL.

---

## Administration

### Automations
Rule engine (trigger → conditions → actions), MANAGER+.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Route | `app/(console)/automations/page.tsx` |
| Actions | `lib/actions/automations.ts` — `createRule`, `updateRule`, `toggleRule`, `deleteRule` |
| Engine | `lib/automations.ts` — `runAutomations(trigger, ticketId)` (direct DB writes, never user actions, so it can't recurse) |
| Components | `components/automations/` — `rule-builder`, `toggle-switch` |

Internal-note actions are authored by a pseudo **"Automation"** system account (inactive, no login) via `getAutomationUserId()` in `lib/system-user.ts`, so automated comments are clearly attributed to the system rather than an admin.

### Syncs / Integrations
External data sync connectors (e.g. directory/asset imports), MANAGER+.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Routes | `app/(console)/syncs/page.tsx`, `[id]/page.tsx` |
| Actions | `lib/actions/syncs.ts` — `runSync`, `toggleSyncActive` |
| Components | `components/syncs/` — `run-button`, `toggle-active` |

### Settings
A hub page (`app/(console)/settings/page.tsx`, MANAGER+) linking to sub-pages:

| Sub-page | Route | Purpose | Actions / components |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| API tokens | `settings/api/page.tsx` | Create/revoke API tokens | `lib/actions/tokens.ts` (`createApiToken`, `revokeApiToken`); `components/settings/token-manager` |
| Mail | `settings/mail/page.tsx` | SMTP status + mail queue (`lib/mail.ts`, `smtpConfigured`) | Read-only view of the mail log |
| SLA | `settings/sla/page.tsx` | Manage SLA policies | `lib/actions/sla-admin.ts` (`createSla`, `updateSla`, `toggleSla`, `deleteSla`); `components/settings/sla-manager` |

See [configuration.md](./configuration.md) for the environment/config side of Mail, SLA, and tokens.

### Notifications
Per-user in-app notification feed, shown as a **popover** opened from the topbar bell (no dedicated route).

| | |
| --- | --- |
| UI | `components/notifications-menu.tsx` — base-ui `Popover` in the topbar bell; loads on open |
| Actions | `lib/actions/notifications.ts` — `listNotifications`, `markAllRead`, `markRead` |
| Entity links | `ENTITY_HREF` map routes `Ticket`/`Problem`/`Change` notifications to their detail pages |

---

## Cross-cutting features

### Search
Global command palette (`Cmd/Ctrl+K` or `/`), not a route.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Component | `components/command-menu.tsx` (mounted in the console layout) |
| Backend | `app/api/search/route.ts` — a Node route handler that fans out across tickets, problems, changes, assets, people, and services, returning grouped `{ group, href, title, sub }` results. Auth-gated via `getSessionUser`. |

### Shared building blocks
Reused across every module, worth knowing before building UI:

| Component | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `components/page-header.tsx` | `PageHeader` + `PageBody` layout wrappers used by nearly every page |
| `components/list-toolbar.tsx`, `pagination-bar.tsx` | List filtering + pagination |
| `components/status-badge.tsx` | `StatusBadge` / `ToneBadge` (driven by `lib/constants.ts` metadata) |
| `components/comments/` | `comment-thread`, `composer-attachments` (shared comment UI) |
| `components/attachments/` | `attachment-list`, `attachments-card`, `file-upload` (paired with `lib/actions/attachments.ts` → `deleteAttachment`) |
| `components/history/entity-history.tsx` | Audit/history timeline |
| `components/edit-entity-dialog.tsx`, `confirm-dialog.tsx`, `empty-state.tsx`, `stat-card.tsx`, `combobox.tsx`, `combo-field.tsx` | Generic primitives |
| `components/ui/` | shadcn/base-ui design-system primitives — see [design-system.md](./design-system.md) |

---

## Portal (self-service)

The requester surface under `app/portal/*`, laid out by `app/portal/layout.tsx` with `components/portal/portal-nav.tsx`.

| Feature | Route | Purpose | Key files |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home | `app/portal/page.tsx` | Requester dashboard: hero with live search, own open tickets, popular answers, catalog preview | `components/portal/portal-hero`, `portal-search`; `db.ticket`/`catalogItem`/`article` |
| Search | `app/api/portal/search/route.ts` | Live help-center search over **public** KB, catalog, and the caller's own tickets | `components/portal/portal-search` |
| Catalog | `app/portal/catalog/page.tsx` | Browse published catalog items (search + category pills) | `components/catalog/catalog-browser`, `catalog-icon` |
| Request | `app/portal/request/[serviceId]/page.tsx` | Submit a catalog request (dynamic per-service form) | `components/portal/service-request-form`, `request-form`, `portal-attachments`; `lib/actions/catalog.ts` → `createCatalogRequest` → `lib/portal-tickets.ts` |
| New ticket | `app/portal/new/page.tsx` | Raise a plain support ticket | `lib/actions/portal.ts` → `createPortalTicket` → `lib/portal-tickets.ts` |
| My tickets | `app/portal/tickets/page.tsx`, `[id]/page.tsx` | Track own tickets, reply, attach files | `lib/actions/portal.ts` → `addPortalComment`; `components/portal/portal-comment`, `components/attachments/*` |
| Knowledge | `app/portal/knowledge/page.tsx`, `[slug]/page.tsx` | Read published, public-facing KB articles (search + category pills) | `components/portal/knowledge-browser`; only published/public articles surface |
| Ask Vio | widget in `app/portal/layout.tsx` | End-user AI assistant (see [ai.md](ai.md#vio-in-the-self-service-portal-end-users)) | `components/portal/vio-widget`; `lib/portal-assistant.ts`; `app/api/portal/assistant/{route,create}` |

Portal write paths are deliberately narrow and share one routed core (`lib/portal-tickets.ts`): requesters (and Vio, acting as them, confirm-first) can only create tickets/catalog requests, reply on their **own** tickets, and stage attachments (images/PDF/`.eml`, re-parented onto the new ticket). Catalog requests pre-route to the item's service/category team; free-form tickets default to the Service Desk triage team. All privileged mutations stay in the console action files.
