 *
 * The minRole values mirror those declared on the nav items in `lib/nav.ts`.
 * Anything not listed here is a plain console route that only requires AGENT.
 * (The two maps are intentionally kept in sync by hand for now — see the note
 * in proxy.ts / the follow-ups; a future refactor can derive one from the
